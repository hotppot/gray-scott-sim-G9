# gray-scott-sim-G9
This project allows us group members to clone the template repository. Furthermore, there are mainly 3 testing frameworks we should choose. 
Then we should add a README file with detailed instructions for building the application locally, create a build system for the software, and implement continuous integration (CI) for the selected repository.

## Required tools and skills
Git Bash, Clion, Cmake, github, continuous integration (CI), C++,

## Details about 3 tests

### test1: Check that the type of the model parameters (F , k) matches that of the element typeof the u and v vectors.
Codes:

### test2: Check that the variables u and v are the same size.
Codes:

### test3: Check that the simulation produces the mathematically correct answer when u = 0 and v = 0.
Codes:
