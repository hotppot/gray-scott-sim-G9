# gray-scott-sim-G9

## Project introduction:
This project allows us group members to clone the template repository. Furthermore, there are mainly 3 testing frameworks we should choose. 
Then we should add a README file with detailed instructions for building the application locally, create a build system for the software, and implement continuous integration (CI) for the selected repository.


## Build System







## CI





## Required tools and skills
Git Bash, Clion, Cmake, github, continuous integration (CI), google-test, C++

## Details about 3 tests

### test1: Check that the type of the model parameters (F , k) matches that of the element typeof the u and v vectors.

### test2: Check that the variables u and v are the same size.
